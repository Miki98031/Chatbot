ISO 19011 benefits them by providing guidance and standards for effectively managing and conducting audits, ensuring competence and evaluation of auditors and audit teams, and facilitating the implementation and improvement of management systems.

This International Standard is based on the quality management principles described in ISO 9000.

The descriptions include examples of benefits associated with each of the quality management principles mentioned.

The descriptions include examples of typical actions to improve the organization's performance when applying these quality management principles.

The PDCA cycle can be applied to all processes and to the quality management system as a whole.

The four steps of the PDCA cycle are:
- Plan: establish the objectives of the system and its processes, identify and address risks and opportunities.
- Do: implement what was planned.
- Check: monitor and measure processes and the resulting products and services against policies, objectives, requirements, and planned activities, and report the results.
- Act: take actions to improve performance, as necessary.

Figure 2 represents how Clauses 4 to 10 of the International Standard can be grouped in relation to the PDCA cycle.

Risk-based thinking is essential for achieving an effective quality management system. 

The concept of risk-based thinking has been implicit in previous editions of this International Standard, including actions such as carrying out preventive action to eliminate potential nonconformities and analyzing any nonconformities that occur.

An organization needs to plan and implement actions to address risks and opportunities in order to conform to the requirements of this International Standard.

Addressing both risks and opportunities establishes a basis for increasing the effectiveness of the quality management system, achieving improved results, and preventing negative effects.

Examples of opportunities that can arise from a situation favorable to achieving an intended result include attracting customers, developing new products and services, reducing waste, and improving productivity.

No, not all positive effects of risk result in opportunities.

The concept of risk-based thinking is implicit in previous editions of this International Standard, and it involves understanding the organization's context, determining risks as a basis for planning, and implementing quality management system processes.

Risk-based thinking has been implicit in previous editions of this International Standard through requirements for planning, review, and improvement.

This International Standard specifies requirements for the organization to understand its context.

Risk-based thinking applies to planning and implementing quality management system processes by serving as a basis for planning and assisting in determining the extent of documented information.

This International Standard does not have a separate clause or subclause on preventive action because the concept of preventive action is expressed through the use of risk-based thinking in formulating quality management system requirements.

The concept of preventive action is expressed through the use of risk-based thinking in formulating quality management system requirements.

The application of risk-based thinking in this International Standard has enabled some reduction in prescriptive requirements and their replacement by performance-based requirements, providing greater flexibility.

No, there is no requirement for formal methods for risk management or a documented risk management process.

Yes, organizations can decide whether or not to develop a more extensive risk management methodology than is required by this International Standard.

No, not all processes of a quality management system represent the same level of risk in terms of the organization's ability to meet its objectives.

Under the requirements of 6.1, the organization is responsible for its application of risk-based thinking and the actions it takes to address risk, including whether or not to retain documented information as evidence of its determination of risks.

The purpose of this International Standard is to improve alignment among ISO's International Standards for management systems.

This International Standard enables organizations to use the process approach, coupled with the PDCA cycle and risk-based thinking, to align or integrate their quality management system with the requirements of other management system standards.

ISO 9000 provides essential background for the proper understanding and implementation of this International Standard, while ISO 9004 provides guidance for organizations that choose to progress beyond the requirements of this International Standard.

Annex B provides details of other International Standards on quality management and quality management systems developed by ISO/TC 176.

This International Standard does not include requirements specific to other management systems such as environmental management, occupational health and safety management, or financial management.

Yes, sector-specific quality management system standards based on the requirements of this International Standard have been developed for a number of sectors.

Some sector-specific quality management system standards specify additional quality management system requirements.

Some sector-specific quality management system standards are limited to providing guidance to the application of this International Standard within the particular sector.

A matrix showing the correlation between the clauses of this edition and the previous edition can be found on the ISO/TC 176/SC 2 open access web site at www.iso.org/tc176/sc02/public.

The PDCA cycle and risk-based thinking are used in this International Standard to align or integrate an organization's quality management system with other management system standards.

ISO's framework, as applied in this International Standard, improves alignment among its International Standards for management systems by providing a common approach and structure for organizations to align or integrate their management systems.

The clause structure and some of the terminology have been changed to improve alignment with other management systems standards.

The changes were made to improve alignment with other management systems standards.

No, there is no requirement for organizations to apply the structure and terminology of this International Standard to their quality management system documentation.

The purpose of the clause structure is to provide a coherent presentation of requirements.

The structure and content of documented information should be relevant to its users by relating to both the processes operated by the organization and information maintained for other purposes.

Yes, organizations can choose to use terms which suit their operations instead of the terms used in this International Standard.

Some examples of alternative terms that organizations can use are "records", "documentation", "protocols" instead of "documented information", and "supplier", "partner", "vendor" instead of "external provider".

Table A.1 shows the major differences in terminology between ISO 9001:2008 and ISO 9001:2015.

The major differences in terminology between ISO 9001:2008 and ISO 9001:2015 are shown in Table A.1.

The difference between "products" and "products and services" in the terminology is that ISO 9001:2015 includes both products and services.

The difference between "supplier" and "external provider" in the terminology is that ISO 9001:2015 uses the term "external provider" instead of "supplier".

The purpose of including the term "services" in ISO 9001:2008 is to encompass all output categories, including hardware, software, processed materials, and services.

The inclusion of "services" in ISO 9001:2008 highlights the differences between products and services by recognizing that services have a characteristic where at least part of the output is realized at the interface with the customer. This means that conformity to requirements for services cannot necessarily be confirmed before service delivery.

No answer.

The organization should consider factors such as the size or complexity of the organization, the management model it adopts, the range of the organization's activities, and the nature of the risks and opportunities it encounters.

The requirements for applicability are addressed in section 4.3 of the International Standard.

An organization can decide that a requirement cannot be applied if its decision will not result in failure to achieve conformity of products and services.
