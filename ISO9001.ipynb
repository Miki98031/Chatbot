       "  \"So in this class, we've tried to convey to you a broad set of principl es and tools that will \\nbe useful for doing many, many things. And ev ery time I teach this class, I can actually \\nvery confidently say that af ter December, no matter what yo u're going to do after this \\nDecember when you've sort of completed this  class, you'll find the things you learn in \\nthis class very useful, and these things will be useful pretty much no matter what you end \\nup doing later in your life.  \\nSo I have more logistics to go over later, but let's say a few more words about machine \\nlearning. I feel that machine learning grew out of  early work in AI, early work in artificial \\nintelligence. And over the last — I wanna say last 15 or last 20 years or so, it's been viewed as a sort of growing new capability for computers. And in particular, it turns out \\nthat there are many programs or there are many applications that you can't program by \\nhand.\",\n",
       "  \"that there are many programs or there are many applications that you can't program by \\nhand.  \\nFor example, if you want to get a computer to read handwritten characters, to read sort of \\nhandwritten digits, that actual ly turns out to be amazingly difficult to write a piece of \\nsoftware to take this input, an image of some thing that I wrote and to  figure out just what \\nit is, to translate my cursive handwriting into — to extract the characters I wrote out in \\nlonghand. And other things: One thing that my students and I do is autonomous flight. It \\nturns out to be extremely difficult to sit dow n and write a program to  fly a helicopter.  \\nBut in contrast, if you want to do things like to get software to fl y a helicopter or have \\nsoftware recognize handwritten digits, one very  successful approach is to use a learning \\nalgorithm and have a computer learn by its elf how to, say, recognize your handwriting.\",\n",
       "  \"algorithm and have a computer learn by its elf how to, say, recognize your handwriting. \\nAnd in fact, handwritten digit recognition, this is pretty much the only approach that \\nworks well. It uses applications that are hard to program by hand.  \\nLearning algorithms has also made I guess sign ificant inroads in what's sometimes called \\ndatabase mining. So, for example, with the growth of IT and computers, increasingly \\nmany hospitals are keeping around medical reco rds of what sort of patients, what \\nproblems they had, what their prognoses was,  what the outcome was. And taking all of \\nthese medical records, which started to be digitized only about maybe 15 years, applying \\nlearning algorithms to them can turn raw medi cal records into what I might loosely call \\nmedical knowledge in which we start to detect trends in medical practice and even start to \\nalter medical practice as a result of me dical knowledge that's derived by applying\",\n",
       "  \"alter medical practice as a result of me dical knowledge that's derived by applying \\nlearning algorithms to the sorts of medical r ecords that hospitals have just been building \\nover the last 15, 20 years in an electronic format.  \\nTurns out that most of you probably use learning algorithms — I don't know — I think \\nhalf a dozen times a day or maybe a dozen  times a day or more, and often without \\nknowing it. So, for example, every time you se nd mail via the US Postal System, turns \\nout there's an algorithm that tries to automa tically read the zip code you wrote on your \\nenvelope, and that's done by a learning al gorithm. So every time you send US mail, you \\nare using a learning algorithm, perhap s without even being aware of it.\",\n",

So \\nevery time you write a check, there's anot her learning algorithm that you're probably \\nusing without even being aware of it.  \\nIf you use a credit card, or I know at least one phone compan y was doing this, and lots of \\ncompanies like eBay as well that do electr onic transactions, there's a good chance that \\nthere's a learning algorithm in the backgr ound trying to figure out if, say, your credit \\ncard's been stolen or if someone's engaging in a fraudulent transaction.  \\nIf you use a website like Amazon or Netflix that will often recommend books for you to \\nbuy or movies for you to rent or whatever , these are other examples of learning\",\n",

What is machine learning? Actually, \\ncan you read the text out there? Raise your hand if the text on the small screens is legible. \\nOh, okay, cool, mostly legible. Okay. So I'll just read it out.  \\nSo what is machine learning? Way back in  about 1959, Arthur Samuel defined machine\",\n",
       "  'So what is machine learning? Way back in  about 1959, Arthur Samuel defined machine \\nlearning informally as the [inaudible] that gives computers to learn — [inaudible] that \\ngives computers the ability to learn without  being explicitly programmed. So Arthur \\nSamuel, so way back in the history of m achine learning, actually did something very \\ncool, which was he wrote a checkers progr am, which would play games of checkers \\nagainst itself.  \\nAnd so because a computer can play thousands  of games against itself relatively quickly, \\nArthur Samuel had his program play thousands  of games against itself, and over time it \\nwould start to learn to rec ognize patterns which led to wi ns and patterns which led to \\nlosses. So over time it learned things like that , \"Gee, if I get a lot of pieces taken by the \\nopponent, then I\\'m more likely to lose than win,\" or, \"Gee, if I get my pieces into a \\ncertain position, then I\\'m especially li kely to win rather than lose.\"',\n",
       "  'certain position, then I\\'m especially li kely to win rather than lose.\"  \\nAnd so over time, Arthur Samuel had a check ers program that woul d actually learn to \\nplay checkers by learning what are the sort of  board positions that tend to be associated \\nwith wins and what are the boa rd positions that tend to be associated with losses. And \\nway back around 1959, the amazing thing about this was that his program actually \\nlearned to play checkers much better than Arthur Samuel  himself could.',\n",
       "  \"So even today, there are some people that say, well, computers can't do anything that \\nthey're not explicitly programmed to. And Ar thur Samuel's checkers program was maybe \\nthe first I think really convi ncing refutation of this clai m. Namely, Arthur Samuel \\nmanaged to write a checkers program that could play checkers much better than he \\npersonally could, and this is an instance of maybe computers learning to do things that \\nthey were not programmed explicitly to do.  \\nHere's a more recent, a more modern, more formal definition of machine learning due to \\nTom Mitchell, who says that a well-posed le arning problem is defined as follows: He \\nsays that a computer program is set to lear n from an experience E with respect to some \\ntask T and some performance measure P if  its performance on T as measured by P \\nimproves with experience E. Okay. So not  only is it a definition, it even rhymes.  \\nSo, for example, in the case of checkers, th e experience E that a program has would be\",\n",
       "  \"So, for example, in the case of checkers, th e experience E that a program has would be \\nthe experience of playing lots of games of checkers against itself, say. The task T is the \\ntask of playing checkers, a nd the performance measure P will be something like the \\nfraction of games it wins against a cert ain set of human opponents. And by this \\ndefinition, we'll say that Arthur Samuel's ch eckers program has learned to play checkers, \\nokay?  \\nSo as an overview of what we're going to do in this class, this class is sort of organized \\ninto four major sections. We're gonna talk about four major topics in this class, the first \\nof which is supervised learning. So le t me give you an example of that.  \\nSo suppose you collect a data set of housing prices. And one of the TAs, Dan Ramage, \\nactually collected a data set for me last week to use in the example later. But suppose that \\nyou go to collect statistics about how much hous es cost in a certain geographic area. And\",\n",
       "  \"you go to collect statistics about how much hous es cost in a certain geographic area. And \\nDan, the TA, collected data from housing pr ices in Portland, Oregon. So what you can do \\nis let's say plot the square footage of the house against the list price of  the house, right, so \\nyou collect data on a bunch of houses. And let' s say you get a data set like this with \\nhouses of different sizes that are li sted for different amounts of money.  \\nNow, let's say that I'm trying to sell a hous e in the same area as Portland, Oregon as \\nwhere the data comes from. Let's say I have a hou se that's this size in square footage, and \\nI want an algorithm to tell me about how much should I expect my house to sell for. So there are lots of ways to do this, and some of you may have seen elements of what I'm \\nabout to say before.  \\nSo one thing you could do is look at this data and maybe put a straight  line to it. And then\",\n",
       "  \"about to say before.  \\nSo one thing you could do is look at this data and maybe put a straight  line to it. And then \\nif this is my house, you may then look at th e straight line and predict that my house is \\ngonna go for about that much money, right? Ther e are other decisions that we can make, \\nwhich we'll talk about later, which is, well, what if I don' t wanna put a straight line? \\nMaybe I should put a quadratic function to it. Ma ybe that fits the data a little bit better. \\nYou notice if you do that, the price of my house goes up a bit, so that'd be nice.\",\n",
       "  \"And this sort of learning pr oblem of learning to predict hous ing prices is an example of \\nwhat's called a supervised learning problem. And the reason that it's called supervised \\nlearning is because we're providing the al gorithm a data set of a bunch of square \\nfootages, a bunch of housing sizes, and as well as sort of the right answer of what the \\nactual prices of a number  of houses were, right?  \\nSo we call this supervised learning because we're supervising the algorithm or, in other \\nwords, we're giving the algorithm the, quote,  right answer for a number of houses. And \\nthen we want the algorithm to learn the a ssociation between the inputs and the outputs \\nand to sort of give us more of the right answers, okay?  \\nIt turns out this specific exam ple that I drew here is an example of something called a \\nregression problem. And the term regression sort of refers to the fact that the variable \\nyou're trying to predict is a continuous value and price.\",\n",
       "  \"regression problem. And the term regression sort of refers to the fact that the variable \\nyou're trying to predict is a continuous value and price.  \\nThere's another class of supervised learning problems which we'll talk about, which are \\nclassification problems. And so, in a classifi cation problem, the variab le you're trying to \\npredict is discreet rather than continuous . So as one specific example — so actually a \\nstandard data set you can download online [i naudible] that lots of machine learning \\npeople have played with. Let's say you collect  a data set on breast cancer tumors, and you \\nwant to learn the algorithm to predict wh ether or not a certai n tumor is malignant. \\nMalignant is the opposite of benign, right, so ma lignancy is a sort of harmful, bad tumor. \\nSo we collect some number of features, some  number of properties of these tumors, and \\nfor the sake of sort of having a simple [inaudi ble] explanation, let's just say that we're\",\n",
       "  \"for the sake of sort of having a simple [inaudi ble] explanation, let's just say that we're \\ngoing to look at the size of the tumor and depe nding on the size of the tumor, we'll try to \\nfigure out whether or not the tu mor is malignant or benign.  \\nSo the tumor is either malignant or benign, and so  the variable in the Y axis is either zero \\nor 1, and so your data set ma y look something like that, righ t? And that's 1 and that's \\nzero, okay? And so this is an example of a classification problem where the variable \\nyou're trying to predict is a discreet value. It 's either zero or 1.  \\nAnd in fact, more generally, there will be many learning problems where we'll have more \\nthan one input variable, more than one input f eature and use more than one variable to try \\nto predict, say, whether a tumor is malignant  or benign. So, for example, continuing with \\nthis, you may instead have a data  set that looks like this. I'm gonna part this data set in a\",\n",
       "  'this, you may instead have a data  set that looks like this. I\\'m gonna part this data set in a \\nslightly different way now. And I\\'m making this  data set look much cleaner than it really \\nis in reality for illustration, okay?  \\nFor example, maybe the crosses indicate ma lignant tumors and the \"O\"s may indicate \\nbenign tumors. And so you may have a data se t comprising patients of  different ages and \\nwho have different tumor sizes and where a cross indicates a mali gnant tumor, and an \\n\"O\" indicates a benign tumor. And you may want  an algorithm to learn to predict, given a \\nnew patient, whether their tumo r is malignant or benign.',\n",
       "  \"So, for example, what a learning algorithm ma y do is maybe come in and decide that a \\nstraight line like that separates the two classes of tumors really well, and so if you have a \\nnew patient who's age and tumor size fall over there, then the algorithm may predict that \\nthe tumor is benign rather than malignant, oka y? So this is just another example of \\nanother supervised learning problem and another classification problem.  \\nAnd so it turns out that one of the issues we' ll talk about later in this class is in this \\nspecific example, we're going to try to predic t whether a tumor is malignant or benign \\nbased on two features or based on two inputs, namely the age of the patient and the tumor \\nsize. It turns out that when you look at a real  data set, you find th at learning algorithms \\noften use other sets of features . In the breast cancer data ex ample, you also use properties \\nof the tumors, like clump thic kness, uniformity of cell size, uniformity of cell shape,\",\n",
       "  \"of the tumors, like clump thic kness, uniformity of cell size, uniformity of cell shape, \\n[inaudible] adhesion and so on, so va rious other medical properties.  \\nAnd one of the most interesting things we'll ta lk about later this quarter is what if your \\ndata doesn't lie in a two-dimensional or th ree-dimensional or sort of even a finite \\ndimensional space, but is it possible — what if your data actually lies in an infinite \\ndimensional space? Our plots here are two-dime nsional space. I can't plot you an infinite \\ndimensional space, right? And so it turns out that one of the most successful classes of \\nmachine learning algorithms — some may call support vector machines — actually takes \\ndata and maps data to an infinite dimensi onal space and then does classification using not \\ntwo features like I've done  here, but an infinite number of features.  \\nAnd that will actually be one of the most fa scinating things we talk about when we go\",\n",
       "  \"And that will actually be one of the most fa scinating things we talk about when we go \\ndeeply into classification al gorithms.

How do you even represent a \\npoint that lies in an infinite dimensional sp ace? We'll talk about that when we get to \\nsupport vector machines, okay?  \\nSo let's see. So that was supervised learning. The second of the four major topics of this \\nclass will be learning theory. So I have a friend who teaches math at a different \\nuniversity, not at Stanford, and when you talk to  him about his work and what he's really \\nout to do, this friend of mine will — he's a ma th professor, right? — this friend of mine \\nwill sort of get the look of wonder in his eyes, and he'll tell you about how in his\",\n",

In this class,  I'm gonna talk about \\nlearning theory to try to convey to y ou an understanding of how and why learning \\nalgorithms work so that we can apply these lear ning algorithms as effectively as possible.  \\nSo, for example, it turns out you can prove su rprisingly deep theorems on when you can \\nguarantee that a learning algorithm will wo rk, all right? So think about a learning\",\n",
       "  \"algorithm for reading zip codes. When can  you prove a theorem guaranteeing that a \\nlearning algorithm will be at least 99.9 per cent accurate on reading zip codes? This is \\nactually somewhat surprising. We actually prove theorems showing when you can expect \\nthat to hold.  \\nWe'll also sort of delve into learning theo ry to try to understand what algorithms can \\napproximate different functions well and also  try to understand things like how much \\ntraining data do you need? So how many exampl es of houses do I need in order for your \\nlearning algorithm to recognize the pattern be tween the square footage of a house and its \\nhousing price? And this will help  us answer questions like if you're trying to design a \\nlearning algorithm, should you be spending more time collecting more data or is it a case \\nthat you already have enough data; it would be  a waste of time to try to collect more. \\nOkay?  \\nSo I think learning algorithms are a very powerful tool that  as I walk around sort of\",\n",
       "  \"Okay?  \\nSo I think learning algorithms are a very powerful tool that  as I walk around sort of \\nindustry in Silicon Valley or as I work with  various businesses in CS and outside CS, I \\nfind that there's often a huge differen ce between how well so meone who really \\nunderstands this stuff can appl y a learning algorithm versus so meone who sort of gets it \\nbut sort of doesn't.  \\nThe analogy I like to think of  is imagine you were going to a carpentry school instead of \\na machine learning class, right? If you go to a carpentry school, they can give you the \\ntools of carpentry. They'll give you a hamme r, a bunch of nails, a screwdriver or \\nwhatever. But a master carpenter will be able to  use those tools far better than most of us \\nin this room. I know a carpen ter can do things with a hammer and nail that I couldn't \\npossibly.

       "  \"possibly. And it's actually a littl e bit like that in machine learning, too. One thing that's \\nsadly not taught in many courses on machine l earning is how to take the tools of machine \\nlearning and really, really apply them well.  \\nSo in the same way, so the tools of machin e learning are I wanna say quite a bit more \\nadvanced than the tools of carpentry. Maybe a carpenter will disagree . But a large part of \\nthis class will be just givi ng you the raw tools of machine learning, just the algorithms \\nand so on. But what I plan to do throughout this entire quarter, not just in the segment of \\nlearning theory, but actually as a theme r unning through everything I do this quarter, will \\nbe to try to convey to you the skills to real ly take the learning al gorithm ideas and really \\nto get them to work on a problem.  \\nIt's sort of hard for me to stand here and say how big a deal that is, but when I walk \\naround companies in Silicon Valley, it's co mpletely not uncommon for me to see\",\n",

I hope all of you will be \\nreally good at applying these learning algor ithms and getting them to work amazingly \\nwell in many problems. Okay?  \\nLet's see. So [inaudible] the board. After lear ning theory, there's a nother class of learning \\nalgorithms that I then want to teach you a bout, and that's unsupervised learning. So you \\nrecall, right, a little ea rlier I drew an example like this , right, where you have a couple of \\nfeatures, a couple of input vari ables and sort of malignant tumors and benign tumors or \\nwhatever. And that was an example of a s upervised learning problem because the data \\nyou have gives you the right answer for each of your patients. The data tells you this \\npatient has a malignant tumor;  this patient has a benign tumor. So it had the right\",\n",
       "  'patient has a malignant tumor;  this patient has a benign tumor. So it had the right \\nanswers, and you wanted the algorithm to just produce more of the same.  \\nIn contrast, in an unsupervised learning problem , this is the sort of data you get, okay? \\nWhere speaking loosely, you\\'re given a data se t, and I\\'m not gonna tell you what the right \\nanswer is on any of your data. I\\'m just gonna give you a data set and I\\'m gonna say, \"Would you please find interesting structure in this data set?\" So that\\'s the unsupervised \\nlearning problem where you\\'re sort of not given the right answer for everything.  \\nSo, for example, an algorithm may find structure in the data in the form of the data being \\npartitioned into two clusters, or clustering is  sort of one example of an unsupervised \\nlearning problem.  \\nSo I hope you can see this. It turns out that th ese sort of unsupervised  learning algorithms \\nare also used in many problems. This is a scr een shot — this is a picture I got from Sue',\n",

It turns \\nout what you can do is if you give this sort of  data, say an image, to certain unsupervised \\nlearning algorithms, they will then learn to group pixels together and say, gee, this sort of \\npixel seems to belong together , and that sort of pixel seems to belong together.  \\nAnd so the images you see on the bottom — I guess you can just barely see them on there\",\n",

This is \\na video of our helicopter at Stanford flying using a contro ller that was learned using a \\nreinforcement learning algorithm. So this wa s done on the Stanford football field, and \\nwe'll zoom out the camera in a second. You'll sort of see th e trees planted in the sky. So\",\n",
       "  'we\\'ll zoom out the camera in a second. You\\'ll sort of see th e trees planted in the sky. So \\nmaybe this is one of the most difficult aer obatic maneuvers flown on any helicopter under \\ncomputer control. And this controller, which is very, very hard for a human to sit down \\nand write out, was learned using one of these reinforcement learning algorithms.  \\nJust a word about that: The basic idea behi nd a reinforcement learning algorithm is this \\nidea of what\\'s called a reward  function. What we have to think about is imagine you\\'re \\ntrying to train a dog. So every time y our dog does something good, you say, \"Good dog,\" \\nand you reward the dog. Every time your dog does something bad, you go, \"Bad dog,\" right? And hopefully, over time, your dog will lear n to do the right things to get more of \\nthe positive rewards, to get mo re of the \"Good dogs\" and to ge t fewer of the \"Bad dogs.”',\n",
       "  'So the way we teach a helicopter to fly or any of these robots is sort of the same thing. \\nEvery time the helicopter crashes, we go, \"B ad helicopter,\" and every time it does the \\nright thing, we go, \"Good helicopter, \" and over time it learns how to control itself so as to \\nget more of these positive rewards.  \\nSo reinforcement learning is — I think of it as a way for you to specify what you want \\ndone, so you have to specify what is a \"good dog\" and what is a \"bad dog\" behavior. And \\nthen it\\'s up to the learning algorithm to  figure out how to maximize the \"good dog\" \\nreward signals and minimize the \"bad dog\" punishments.  \\nSo it turns out reinforcement learning is applie d to other problems in robotics. It\\'s applied \\nto things in web crawling and so on. But it\\'s just  cool to show videos, so let me just show \\na bunch of them. This learning algorithm was actually implemented by our head TA, Zico, of programming a four-legged dog. I guess Sam Shriver in this class also worked',\n",
       "  \"on the project and Peter Renfrew and Mike and a few others. But I guess this really is a \\ngood dog/bad dog since it's a robot dog.  \\nThe second video on the right, some of the st udents, I guess Peter, Zico, Tonca working \\non a robotic snake, again using learning algorith ms to teach a snake robot to climb over \\nobstacles.  \\nBelow that, this is kind of a fun example.

Sorry. I know the video's kind of small.

I'll say a little bit about that later, but the essential learni ng algorithm for this is \\nsomething called gradient descent, which I will  talk about later in today's lecture. Let's \\nwatch the video. [Video plays]  \\nInstructor (Andrew Ng) :So two comments, right. One is this is supervised learning \\nbecause it's learning from a human driver, in  which a human driver shows that we're on \\nthis segment of the road, I will steer at this angle.

So on the upper left where the m ouse pointer is moving, this horizontal line \\nactually shows the human steering direction, and this white bar, or this white area right \\nhere shows the steering direction chosen by the human driver, by moving the steering \\nwheel.  \\nThe human is steering a little bit to the left here indicated  by the position of this white \\nregion.

So what  you just saw was an example, again, of \\nsupervised learning, and in particular it was an  example of what they  call the regression \\nproblem, because the vehicle is trying to predict a continuous value variables of a \\ncontinuous value steering directions , we call the regression problem.  \\nAnd what I want to do today is talk about our first supervised learning algorithm, and it \\nwill also be to a regression task.

Oka y, so throughout this quarter, I\\'m going \\nto use the alphabet M to denot e the number of training examples. I\\'m going to use the \\nlower case alphabet X to denote the input variable s, which I\\'ll often also call the features. \\nAnd so in this case, X would denote the size of the house they were looking at.  \\nI\\'m going to use Y to denote the \"output\" va riable, which is sometimes also called a \\ntarget variable, and so one pair, x, y, is wh at comprises one training example.

Don't worry too mu ch about whether the term hypothesis has a \\ndeep meaning. It's more a term that's used for historical reasons.  \\nAnd the hypothesis's job is to take this i nput. There's some new [inaudible]. What the \\nhypothesis does is it takes this  input, a new living area in s quare feet saying and output \\nestimates the price of this house.

So for example, if instead of  just knowing the size \\nof the houses, if we know also the number of  bedrooms in these houses, let's say, then, so \\nif our training set also has a second feature,  the number of bedrooms in the house, then \\nyou may, let's say X1 denote the size and squa re feet.

And so this is the price that my hypothesis predicts a house with features X costs. So \\ngiven the new house with features X, a certa in size and a certain number of bedrooms, \\nthis is going to be the price that my hypothe sis predicts this house is going to cost.  \\nOne final piece of notation, so for conciseness, just to write this a bit more compactly I'm \\ngoing to take the convention of defining X0 to be equal to one, and so I can now write H \\nof X to be equal to sum from I equals one to two of theta I, oh sorr y, zero to two, theta I,\",\n",

Ok ay, so in this case we need to work out \\nwhat the partial derivative with respect to the parameter theta I of J of theta. If we have \\nonly one training example then J of theta is goi ng to be one-half of script theta, of X \\nminus Y, script. So if you have only one training example comprising one pair, X, Y, \\nthen this is what J of theta is going to be.  \\nAnd so taking derivatives, you have one-h alf something squared. So the two comes\",\n",
       "  \"then this is what J of theta is going to be.  \\nAnd so taking derivatives, you have one-h alf something squared. So the two comes \\ndown. So you have two times one-half times  theta of X minus Y, and then by the \\n[inaudible] derivatives, we also  must apply this by the deri vative of what's inside the \\nsquare. Right, the two and the one-half cancel. So  this leaves [inaudible] times that, theta \\nzero, X zero plus [inaudible].  \\nOkay, and if you look inside this sum, we're ta king the partial derivative of this sum with \\nrespect to the parameter theta I. But all th e terms in the sum, except for one, do not \\ndepend on theta I. In this sum, the only term  that depends on theta I will be some term \\nhere of theta I, X I. And so we take the partia l derivative with respect to theta I, X I – take \\nthe partial derivative with respec t to theta I of this term thet a I, X I, and so you get that \\ntimes X I.\",\n",
       "  \"the partial derivative with respec t to theta I of this term thet a I, X I, and so you get that \\ntimes X I.  \\nOkay, and so this gives us our learning rule, ri ght, of theta I gets updated as theta I minus \\nalpha times that. Okay, and this Greek alphabet alpha here is a parameter of the algorithm \\ncalled the learning rate, and this parameter al pha controls how large a step you take. So \\nyou're standing on the hill. You decided what di rection to take a st ep in, and so this \\nparameter alpha controls how a ggressive – how large a step y ou take in this direction of \\nsteepest descent.\",\n",
       "  \"And so if you – and this is a parameter of the algorithm that's often set by hand.

I'm going to show \\nyou what this looks like when you run the algor ithm.

And so we'll always ha ve a nice bow shape, like what you see up \\nhere, and only have one global mini mum with no other local optima.  \\nSo when you run gradient descent, here are actu ally the contours of the function J.

       "  \"parameters.

The \\nfunction, J of theta has no local optima. Yes, question?  \\nStudent: Is the alpha changing every time?

       "  \"you approach the local minimum, it actually ta kes smaller and smaller steps so they'll \\nconverge.

So \\nas it turns out – maybe the TAs can talk a bit more about this at th e section if there's \\ninterest.

Yeah, maybe the TAs \\ncan talk a bit more about this on Friday.  \\nOkay, let's see, so let me go ahead and give this algorithm a specific name. So this \\nalgorithm here is actually called batch gradient  descent, and the term batch isn't a great \\nterm, but the term batch refers to the fact that on every step of gradient descent you're \\ngoing to look at your entire training set. You're going to perform a sum over your M \\ntraining examples.  \\nSo [inaudible] descent often works very well.  I use it very often, and it turns out that \\nsometimes if you have a really, really large tr aining set, imagine that instead of having 47\",\n",
       "  \"sometimes if you have a really, really large tr aining set, imagine that instead of having 47 \\nhouses from Portland, Oregon in our training set, if you had, say, the U.S. Census Database or something, with U.S. census size databases you often have hundreds of \\nthousands or millions of training examples.  \\nSo if M is a few million then if you're running batch rate and descent,  this means that to \\nperform every step of gradient descent you need  to perform a sum from J equals one to a\",\n",
       "  \"million. That's sort of a lot of training ex amples where your computer programs have to \\nlook at, before you can even take one st ep downhill on the func tion J of theta.  \\nSo it turns out that when you have very la rge training sets, you should write down an \\nalternative algorithm that is called [inaudible]  gradient descent. Sometimes I'll also call it \\nincremental gradient descent, but the algorith m is as follows. Again, it will repeat until \\nconvergence and will iterate for J equals one to  M, and will perform one of these sort of \\ngradient descent updates using just the J training example.  \\nOh, and as usual, this is really – you update  all the parameters data runs. You perform \\nthis update for all values of I. For I indexe s and the parameter vectors, you just perform \\nthis update, all of your parameters simultaneous ly. And the advantage of this algorithm is \\nthat in order to start learning, in order to start modifying the parameters, you only need to\",\n",

And you sort of keep adapting your \\nparameters much more quickly without need ing to scan over your entire U.S. Census \\ndatabase before you can even start adapting parameters.  \\nSo let's see, for launch data sets, so constant ly gradient descent is often much faster, and \\nwhat happens is that constant gradient des cent is that it won't actually converge to the \\nglobal minimum exactly, but if these are the contours of your function, then after you run \\nthe constant gradient descent, you sort of tend to wander around.  \\nAnd you may actually end up going uphill occasionally, but your parameters will sort of\",\n",

And when we’re talking about linear regression or linear l east squares, we use \\nthis to denote the predicted value of “by my hypothesis H” on the input XI. And my \\nhypothesis was franchised by the vector of gram s as theta and so we said that this was \\nequal to some from theta J, si J, and more  theta transpose X. And we had the convention \\nthat X subscript Z is equal to one so this accounts for the intercept term in our linear regression model. And lowercas e n here was the notation I was using for the number of \\nfeatures in my training set. Okay? So in  the example when trying to predict housing',\n",
       "  'features in my training set. Okay? So in  the example when trying to predict housing \\nprices, we had two features, the size of the house and the number of bedrooms. We had \\ntwo features and there was – li ttle n was equal to two. So just to finish recapping the \\nprevious lecture, we define d this quadratic cos function J of theta equals one-half, \\nsomething I equals one to m, theta of XI mi nus YI squared where this is the sum over our \\nm training examples and my training set. So lowercase m was the notation I’ve been \\nusing to denote the number of training exampl es I have and the size of my training set. \\nAnd at the end of the last lecture, we deri ve the value of theta that minimizes this \\nenclosed form, which was X transpose X inverse X transpose Y. Okay?  \\nSo as we move on in today’s lecture, I’ll cont inue to use this notation and, again, I realize \\nthis is a fair amount of notation to all reme mber, so if partway th rough this lecture you',\n",
       "  'this is a fair amount of notation to all reme mber, so if partway th rough this lecture you \\nforgot – if you’re having trouble remembering what lowercase m is or what lowercase n \\nis or something please raise your hand and ask. When we talked about linear regression \\nlast time we used two features. One of the f eatures was the size of the houses in square \\nfeet, so the living area of the house, and the other feature was the number of bedrooms in \\nthe house. In general, we apply a machine- learning algorithm to some problem that you \\ncare about. The choice of the features will very much be up to you, right? And the way \\nyou choose your features to give the learning algorithm will often have a large impact on \\nhow it actually does. So just for example, the choice we made last time was X1 equal this \\nsize, and let’s leave this idea of the feature of the number of bedrooms for now, let’s say \\nwe don’t have data that tells us how many bedrooms are in these houses. One thing you',\n",
       "  'could do is actually define – oh, let’s draw this out. And s o, right? So say that was the \\nsize of the house and that’s th e price of the house. So if you use this as a feature maybe \\nyou get theta zero plus theta 1, X1, this, sort of, linear model. If you choose – let me just copy the same data set over, right? You can de fine the set of features where X1 is equal \\nto the size of the house and X2 is the square of the size of the house. Okay? So X1 is the \\nsize of the house in say square footage and X2 is just take wh atever the square footage of \\nthe house is and just square that number, and this would be another way to come up with \\na feature, and if you do that then the sa me algorithm will end up fitting a quadratic \\nfunction for you. Theta 2, XM squared. Ok ay? Because this is actually X2. And \\ndepending on what the data looks like, maybe th is is a slightly better fit to the data.  \\nYou can actually take this even further, right?  Which is – let’s see. I have seven training',\n",
       "  'You can actually take this even further, right?  Which is – let’s see. I have seven training \\nexamples here, so you can actually maybe fit up to six for the polynomial.

X to the power of six and theta six are the polynomial to  these seven data \\npoints. And if you do that you find that you co me up with a model that fits your data \\nexactly. This is where, I guess, in this exampl e I drew, we have seven data points, so if \\nyou fit a six model polynomial you can, sort of, fit a line that  passes through these seven \\npoints perfectly. And you probably find that the curve you get will look something like \\nthat. And on the one hand, this is a great m odel in a sense that it fits your training data \\nperfectly. On the other hand, this is probabl y not a very good model in the sense that \\nnone of us seriously think th at this is a very good predic tor of housing prices as a',\n",
       "  'none of us seriously think th at this is a very good predic tor of housing prices as a \\nfunction of the size of the house, right?  \\nSo we’ll actually come back to this later. It  turns out of the models  we have here; I feel \\nlike maybe the quadratic model fits the data  best. Whereas the linear model looks like \\nthere’s actually a bit of  a quadratic component in this data  that the linear function is not \\ncapturing. So we’ll actually come back to this a little bit later and talk about the problems \\nassociated with fitting models that are either  too simple, use two small a set of features, \\nor on the models that are too complex and maybe  use too large a set of features. Just to \\ngive these a name, we call this the problem of underfitting and, very informally, this \\nrefers to a setting where there are obvious patt erns that – where there are patterns in the \\ndata that the algorithm is just failing to f it.

What I want to do today is talk about a class of algorithms \\ncalled non-parametric learning algorithms that will help to alleviate the need somewhat \\nfor you to choose features very carefully.

And just to de fine the term, linear regression, as we’ve \\ndefined it so far, is an example of a parame tric learning algorithm. Parametric learning \\nalgorithm is one that’s defined as an algorithm that has a fixed number of parameters that \\nfit to the data. Okay? So in linear regression we  have a fix set of parameters theta, right? \\nThat must fit to the data. In contrast, what  I’m gonna talk about now is our first non-\\nparametric learning algorithm.

This will be an \\nalgorithm that allows us to worry a little b it less about having to choose features very \\ncarefully. So for my motivating example, let’s say that I have  a training site  that looks \\nlike this, okay? So this is X and that’s Y.  If you run linear regre ssion on this and you fit \\nmaybe a linear function to this and you end up with a more or less flat, straight line, \\nwhich is not a very good fit to  this data. You can sit around a nd stare at this and try to \\ndecide whether the features are used right. So maybe you want to toss in a quadratic \\nfunction, but this isn’t really quadratic eith er.

Okay? A nd let’s say you want to know what’s the \\npredicted value of Y at this position of X, right? So for lin ear regression, what we were \\ndoing was we would fit theta to minimize sum over I, YI minus theta, transpose XI \\nsquared, and return theta transpose X. Okay?

       "  'And what I’ll do is then evaluate this particular  value of straig ht line and that will be the \\nvalue I return for my algorithm. I think this would be the predicted value for – this would \\nbe the value of then my hypothesis output s in locally weighted regression. Okay?  \\nSo we’re gonna fall one up. Let me go ahead and formalize that. In locally weighted \\nregression, we’re going to fit theta to minimi ze sum over I to minimize that where these \\nterms W superscript I are called weights. Th ere are many possible choice for ways, I’m \\njust gonna write one down. So this E’s and mi nus, XI minus X squared over two. So let’s \\nlook at what these weights really are, right ? So notice that – suppose you have a training \\nexample XI. So that XI is very close to X. So this is small, right? Then if XI minus X is \\nsmall, so if XI minus X is close to zero, th en this is E’s to the minus zero and E to the \\nzero is one. So if XI is close to X, then WI will be close to one. In other words, the',\n",
       "  'zero is one. So if XI is close to X, then WI will be close to one. In other words, the \\nweight associated with the, I training exampl e be close to one if XI and X are close to \\neach other. Conversely if XI minus X is large then – I don’t know, what would WI be?  \\nStudent: Zero.  \\nInstructor (Andrew Ng) :Zero, right. Close to zero. Right. So if XI is very far from X \\nthen this is E to the minus of some large number and E to the minus some large number will be close to zero. Okay? So the picture is, if I’m quarrying at a certain point X, shown on the X axis, and if my data set, say, l ook like that, then I’m going to give the points \\nclose to this a large weight and give the points far away a small weight. So for the points \\nthat are far away, WI will be close to zero. A nd so as if for the points that are far away, \\nthey will not contribute much at all to this  summation, right? So I th ink this is sum over I',\n",
       "  'they will not contribute much at all to this  summation, right? So I th ink this is sum over I \\nof one times this quadratic term for points by points plus zero times this quadratic term \\nfor faraway points. And so the effect of usi ng this weighting is that locally weighted \\nlinear regression fits a set of parameters thet a, paying much more a ttention to fitting the \\npoints close by accurately. Whereas ignoring the contribution from faraway points. \\nOkay? Yeah?  \\nStudent: Your Y is exponentially [inaudible]?  \\nInstructor (Andrew Ng) :Yeah. Let’s see. So it turns out  there are many other weighting \\nfunctions you can use. It turns out that th ere are definitely different communities of \\nresearchers that tend to choose different c hoices by default. There is somewhat of a \\nliterature on debating what point – exactly what function to us e. This, sort of, exponential \\ndecay function is – this happens to be a reas onably common one that seems to be a more',\n",
       "  'decay function is – this happens to be a reas onably common one that seems to be a more \\nreasonable choice on many problems, but you ca n actually plug in other functions as \\nwell.

Okay? But this actually \\nhas absolutely nothing to  do with Gaussian distribution. So this is not that a problem with \\nXI is Gaussian or whatever. This is no su ch interpretation. This is just a convenient \\nfunction that happens to be a bell-shaped f unction, but don’t endow this of any Gaussian \\nsemantics. Okay?',\n",
       "  'So, in fact – well, if you remember the fam iliar bell-shaped Gaussia n, again, it’s just the \\nways of associating with these points is th at if you imagine putti ng this on a bell-shaped \\nbump, centered around the position of where you want to value your hypothesis H, then \\nthere’s a saying this point here I’ll give a wei ght that’s proportional to the height of the \\nGaussian – excuse me, to the height of the bell-shaped function eval uated at this point. \\nAnd the way to get to this point will be, to th is training example, wi ll be proportionate to \\nthat height and so on. Okay? And so training ex amples that are really far away get a very \\nsmall weight.  \\nOne last small generalization to this is that  normally there’s one other parameter to this \\nalgorithm, which I’ll denote as tow. Again, this  looks suspiciously lik e the variants of a \\nGaussian, but this is not a Gaussian. This  is a convenient form or function. This',\n",

This \\nparameter tow is called the bandwidth paramete r and informally it controls how fast the \\nweights fall of with distance. Okay? So just  copy my diagram from the other side, I \\nguess. So if tow is very small, if that’s  a query X, then you end up choosing a fairly \\nnarrow Gaussian – excuse me, a fairly narrow be ll shape, so that the weights of the points \\nare far away fall off rapidly. Whereas if tow is large then you’d end up choosing a \\nweighting function that falls of relatively sl owly with distance from your query. Okay?  \\nSo I hope you can, therefore, see that if you a pply locally weighted li near regression to a \\ndata set that looks like this, th en to ask what your hypothesis out put is at a point like this \\nyou end up having a straight line making that pr ediction.

It turns out that if you, for th e vast majority of problems, if you apply a \\nlinear regression model like this and try to m easure the distribution of the errors, not all \\nthe time, but very often you find that the erro rs really are Gaussian. That this Gaussian \\nmodel is a good assumption for the error in regression proble ms like these. Some of you \\nmay have heard of the central limit theo rem, which says that the sum of many',\n",
       "  'may have heard of the central limit theo rem, which says that the sum of many \\nindependent random variables will tend towards a Gaussian.

If  in practice, I guess, the two real answers \\nare that, 1.) In practice this is actually a reasonably accurate assumption, and 2.) Is it \\nturns out to be mathematically c onvenient to do so. Okay? Yeah?  \\nStudent: It seems like we’re saying if we assu me that area around model has zero mean, \\nthen the area is centered ar ound our model.

So in that se nse, assumptions we make are never “absolutely true,” but \\nfor practical purposes this is a accurate enough assumption that  it’ll be useful to make. \\nOkay? I think in a week or two, we’ll actually come back to selected more about the \\nassumptions we make and when they help our  learning algorithms a nd when they hurt our \\nlearning algorithms. We’ll say a bit more about  it when we talk about generative and \\ndiscriminative learning algorithms, like, in a week or two. Okay?  \\nSo let’s point out one bit of notation, which is that when I wrote this down I actually \\nwrote P of YI given XI and then semicolon theta and I’m going to us e this notation when \\nwe are not thinking of theta as a random vari able.

So if theta is not a random \\nvariable, then I’m going to avoid writing P of  YI given XI comma theta, because this \\nwould mean that probably of YI conditio ned on X and theta and you can only condition \\non random variables. So at this part of the class where we’re taking sort of frequentist’s \\nviewpoint rather than the Dasi an viewpoint, in this part of  class we’re thinking of theta \\nnot as a random variable, but just as so mething we’re trying to estimate and use the \\nsemicolon notation.

Let’s assume that the error terms \\nare IID, okay? Which stands for Independently  and Identically Distributed. So it’s going \\nto assume that the error terms are indepe ndent of each other, right? The identically \\ndistributed part just means that I’m a ssuming the outcome for the same Gaussian \\ndistribution or the same varian ce, but the more important part  of is this is that I’m \\nassuming that the epsilon I’s are independent of  each other. Now, let’s talk about how to \\nfit a model. The probability of Y given X parameterized by theta – I’m actually going to give this another name.

I’m actually going to \\nuse this probabil – use this, sort of, probabilist ic interpretation in order to derive our next \\nlearning algorithm, which will be our first classification algorithm.

I just want to say – take one quick \\ndigression to talk about one more algorithm, which was the discussion sort of alluding to \\nthis earlier, which is the perceptron algorithm, right? So I’m not gonna say a whole lot \\nabout the perceptron algorithm, but this is some thing that we’ll come back to later. Later \\nthis quarter we’ll talk about le arning theory. So in logistic re gression we said that G of Z \\nare, sort of, my hypothesis output values th at were low numbers between zero and one. \\nThe question is what if you want to force G of  Z to up the value to either zero one? So the',\n",
       "  'The question is what if you want to force G of  Z to up the value to either zero one? So the \\nperceptron algorithm defines G of Z to be this. So the picture is – or  the cartoon is, rather \\nthan this sigmoid function. E of Z now looks like this step function that you were asking',\n",
       "  'about earlier. In saying this before, we can use H subscript theta of X equals G of theta \\ntranspose X. Okay? So this is actually – ever ything is exactly the same as before, except \\nthat G of Z is now the step f unction. It turns out there’s this  learning called the perceptron \\nlearning rule that’s actually even the same as the classic gradient ascent for logistic \\nregression. And the learning rule is given by th is. Okay? So it looks just like the classic \\ngradient ascent rule for logist ic regression. So this is very  different flavor of algorithm \\nthan least squares regression and logistic regr ession, and, in particular, because it outputs \\nonly values are either zero or one it turns out  it’s very difficult to  endow this algorithm \\nwith probabilistic semantics. And this is , again, even though – oh, excuse me. Right \\nthere. Okay. And even though this learning ru le looks, again, looks  cosmetically very',\n",
       "  'there. Okay. And even though this learning ru le looks, again, looks  cosmetically very \\nsimilar to what we have in l ogistics regression this is actual ly a very different type of \\nlearning rule than the others that were seen in this class. So because this is such a simple \\nlearning algorithm, right? It ju st computes theta transpose X and then you threshold and \\nthen your output is zero or one . This is – right. So thes e are a simpler algorithm than \\nlogistic regression, I think. When  we talk about learning theory  later in this class, the \\nsimplicity of this algorithm will let us come back and use it as a building block. Okay? \\nBut that’s all I want to say about this algorithm for now.  \\nJust for fun, the last thing I’l l do today is show you a histor ical video with – that talks \\nabout the perceptron algorithm. This particular  video comes from a video series titled The \\nMachine that Changed The World and was produced WGBH Television in cooperation',\n",
       "  'Machine that Changed The World and was produced WGBH Television in cooperation \\nwith the BBC, British Broadcasting Corporati on, and it aired on PBS a few years ago. \\nThis shows you what machine learning used to  be like. It’s a f un clip on perceptron \\nalgorithm.  \\nIn the 1950’s and 60’s scientists built a few work ing perceptrons, as these artificial brains \\nwere called. He’s using it to explore the myster ious problem of how the brain learns. This \\nperceptron is being trained to recognize the difference between males and females. It is \\nsomething that all of us can do easily, but fe w of us can explain how. To get a computer \\nto do this it would involve working out ma ny complex rules about faces and writing a \\ncomputer program, but this perceptron was si mply given lots and lots of examples, \\nincluding some with unus ual hairstyles.
